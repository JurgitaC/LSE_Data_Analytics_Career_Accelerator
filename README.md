## Overview

The **Data Analytics Career Accelerator** from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) equipped me with the technical and analytical skills needed to make data-driven decisions in a variety of industries. Over an intensive six-month period, I worked with tools like Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Râ€”using them to tackle real business challenges.

The program included three structured courses and a hands-on employer project, allowing me to build a strong portfolio. It gave me both the practical experience and confidence to apply data analytics to real-world problems in any organisation.
